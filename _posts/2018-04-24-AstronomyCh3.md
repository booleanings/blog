### 3.1 The Ancient Roots of Science
* Scientific thinking is based on everyday observations and trial-and-error experiments.
* Practical benefits of astronomy
	* Farming - predicting rainfall
	* Navigation
	* Measuring Time

###### Astronomy & Measures of Time
* **length of our day** is the time it takes the Sun to make one full circuit of the sky
* **length of our month** is the length of the Moon's cycle of phases
* **length of our year** is based on the cycle of the seasons
* Even the seven days of the week are named for the seven planets known in ancient times.

###### Solar and Lunar Calendars
* **solar calendar** is a calendar that is synchronized with the seasons so that seasonal events like solstices and equinoxes occur on the same dates each year.
* **lunar calendars** stay synchronized with the lunar cycle so that the moon's phase is always the same on the first of the month.

### 3.2 Ancient Greek Science

* Greeks formalized the **scientific model**, a conceptual representation created to explain and predict observed phenomena.
* Philosophers adopted a **geocentric model** with a spherical Earth at the center of a great celestial sphere.

###### Greeks and Planetary Motion
* To account for the Sun and Moon's slight movement, the Greeks added separate spheres for them with these spheres turning at different rates from the stars' spheres.
* This model didn't explain the apparent retrograde motion of the planets though.
	* The Greeks ended up explaining this through the **Ptolemaic model** in which each planet moves on a small circle whose center moves around Earth on a larger circle.
		* The small circle is called an **epicycle** and the larger circle is called a **deferent**.

### 3.3 The Copernican Revolution
* The **Copernican revolution** is sometimes considered the origin story of modern science.
* Copernicus's sun-centered model was based on the right general ideas, but its predictions were not substantially better than Ptolemy's Earth-centered model
	* This was partially because he still held fast to the idea that the sphere's paths were perfectly circular

###### Tycho
* Tycho helped collect much of the data which would strengthen Copernicus's model
* He also observed a **nova** (new star) and showed it was much farther away than the moon.
* Despite his quality observations, he did not detect stellar parallax and concluded the Earth must be stationary. His final model settled on the Sun orbiting the Earth while all other planets orbit the Sun.

###### Kepler
* Kepler was Tycho's apprentice.
* His key discovery was that planetary orbits are not circles but instead **ellipses** (special types of ovals)
	* An ellipse has two **foci**, a **major axis**, and **semimajor axes**.
	* A circle is an ellipse with zero eccentricity and greater eccentricity means a more elongated ellipse.

###### Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

**Law 1** The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.
	* A planet's distance from the Sun varies during its orbit.
	* A planet is closest to the Sun at it's **perihelion**.
	* A planet is furthest from the Sun at its **aphelion**.
	* The average of a planet's aphelion and perihelion is the length of its *semimajor axis*.

**Law 2** As a planet moves around its elliptical orbit, it moves faster when its nearer the Sun and slower when its farther from the Sun.
