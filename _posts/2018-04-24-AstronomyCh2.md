## Intro
* Sun is our nearest star -> only star whose structure can be seen in detail
* Standard unit for measuring properties of other stars, even galaxies

### Questions about the Sun
##### What's the sun made of?
* Measure composition from spectra (absorption lines)
* Mostly Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon

##### Is it on Fire?
No, it would only last 10,000 years then

##### Is it contracting?
If it were, it would only last ~25 million years

##### What makes the Sun shine?
Powered by **nuclear energy**
`E = mc^2` - Einstein

##### What holds the Sun together?
Gravity. It doesn't collapse further due to the balancing out of pressure and gravity.

### The Sun's Atmosphere
Photosphere -> Chromosphere
##### The Sun's Photosphere
* Outer layer of solar atmosphere from where "the light emerges" (yellow disk we see)
* Few hundred km thick

##### Solar Chromosphere
* Middle layer of Sun's atmosphere - hard to see normally
* 2000 km deep

##### Solar Corona
* Outermost layer of solar atmosphere. 1 million K

### Solar Wind
A flow of charged particles from the surface of the Sun

##### What's in the Sun's interior?
Core, radiative zone, convective zone

##### Sun's surface
* **Granules** bright blobs on photosphere where hot gas reaches the surface, top of convective cells

##### How do we know what is happening inside the Sun?
Patterns of vibration on the surface tell us about sun's interior
* Pressure waves (**P-waves**) in the Sun originate in turbulence in the convective zone
* Detected in time series of images, and with Doppler shifts of absorption lines.

##### Solar Neutrinos
**Neutrinos** created during fusion fly directly through the Sun.

### Solar Activity
##### What causes solar activity?
Solar Activity -> "weather"
* Sunspots, solar flares, solar prominences
* All related to magnetic fields

###### Sunspots
Cooler than other parts of photosphere. Occur when strong magnetic fields emerge through the surface allowing the area to cool slightly.
* Occur in pairs, loops of bright gas often connect sunspot pairs
###### Solar Flares/Prominences
Magnetic activity causes **solar flares** that send bursts of X-rays and charged particles into space.
Magnetic activity also causes **solar prominences** that erupt high above the Sun's surface.
