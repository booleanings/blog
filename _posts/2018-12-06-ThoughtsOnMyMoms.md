# Thoughts on My Mother's Breast Cancer
Dec 6, 2018 at 3:50 PM

_It shouldn't be this hard to find a parking at a hospital_, I thought to myself, as my eyes darted from spot to spot. Parking at a hospital is one of those things you don't think about until you have to think about it, and then all you can do is laugh at the absurdity of it all.

When my mother called to tell me about her positive breast cancer diagnosis, I didn't cry immediately. Between American news and my facebook feed, the topic of cancer had become as heavily saturated as a tart lemonade. I didn't understand what triple negative meant or the details of the stages. Instead of crying, I just turned my car off and went into work.

At my age, sickness is normally one of those things that come and go within a week. The most dramatic illness I had faced was the flu, and I had no clue how to comfort my mom in the time she needed me most.

My mom came by to see me the morning after. Coincidentally, also the morning after a hard night of drinking with friends. My apartment was littered in cigarettes, and I was embarassed for both the condition of my place and living and myself. Normally, she would have scolded me for the dirtiness, but this morning she was suspiciously quiet. She saved me the gory details of the countless doctor's appointments she'd already had. My mother and I hadn't spent a lot of time alone since I moved out at the age of 16. As she sat on a cot chair with her both arms crossed, we discussed regrets. I asked her if she was afraid.

"Cancer is a lonely journey"

She would repeat this mantra throughout her treatment, especially whenever we tried to offer empty condolences. In retrospect, I can see how hurtful it can be to be sitting ringing death's fickle doorbell and for somebody without any knowledge of your treatment or condition to wave a wand and say "Everything will be fine.".

When I shared the news with my friends, most of them responded with "I'm sure she will be ok. I have a cousin_aunt_sister with breast cancer and she was perfectly fine". It can feel intensely disheartening to share such personal news, and be met only with a dismissive attempt at consolation. All they needed to say was, "Are you afraid?"

To be honest, most days I ignored reality like a text from an old friend. _My mom is gonna be fine_, I would repeat to myself as I drove on the highway or sat through a work meeting.

When my mother first announced that she would be having some tests to determine if the lump on her breast was cancerous, her and my sister were in the midst of another catfight over some frivolous thing. As my sister walked me out of my home, she told me that mom was over-exaggerating and it's just a routine test. That moment was all I could think about as I sat in my car outside of work. _My mom was right._ It was one of the few things you don't want your mother to be right about. Predicting her own cancer was just another way to drive it home.

Circling around the hospital parking lot, I thought about how painful it would be to experience a loved one dying in surgery or after a long uphill battle with cancer and then to have to go to this parking lot and spend ten minutes circling around looking for a spot. I chuckled to myself, but instantly felt worse. If my mom died during surgery, would I cry?
