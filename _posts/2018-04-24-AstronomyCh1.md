### Scale of the Universe

- **Earth** is a planet in our solar system consists of the Sun, planets, their moons, and countless smaller objets.
- Our **solar system** belongs to the huge, disk-shaped collection of stars called the Milky Way Galaxy.
- A **galaxy** is a great island of stars in space, held together by gravity and orbiting a common center.
- Groups of galaxies with many large members are called **galaxy clusters**. Regions where there are many galaxies and galaxy clusters are called **superclusters**.
- All of these structures make up our **universe** (the sum total of all matter and energy)

### Astronomical Distance Measurements

- One **astronomical unit (AU)** is Earth's average distance from the Sun (93 million miles).
- One **light year** is the distance that light can travel in 1 year, which is about 6 trillion miles.

### Looking Back in Time

- The father away we look in distance, the further back we look in time.
- A star that is 8 light years away has light that takes about 8 years to reach us, so we're seeing it as it was 8 years ago.

### Basic Astronomical Objects

- A **star** is a large glowing ball of gas that generates heat and light through nuclear fusion in its core.
- A **planet** is a moderately large object that orbits a star and shines primary by reflecting light from its star.
- Must orbit a star, have its own gravity and cleared other objects from its orbital path.
* Planet order - Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto
