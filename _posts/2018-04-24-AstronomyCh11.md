### 2.1 Patterns in the Night Sky

* A  **constellation** is a region of the sky with well-defined borders.
	* There are 88 official constellations.
* Bright stars help us identify constellations.
* Misunderstanding of depth perceptions in looking at constellations led to the inaccurate depiction of a **celestial sphere** where the stars and constellatgrep '^....$' wordsions lie on top of the Earth.
	* All stars appear to lie on the *celestial sphere*, but in reality they lie at different distances from Earth.

* The **north celestial pole** and **south celestial pole** are the points directly over the Earth's North and South poles (respectively).
* The **celestial equator** is a projection of Earth's equator into space.
* The **ecliptic** is the path the Sun follows as it appears to circle around the sphere.

##### Milky Way & Local Sky
* The band of light we call the *Milky Way* circles all the way around the sphere, passing through many constellations.
* The **local sky** is the sky as seen from wherever you happen to be standing. There are some key reference features in this scope:
	* The boundary between the Earth and sky is the **horizon**.
	* The point directly overhead is the **zenith**.
	* The **meridian** is an imaginary half-circle from the south point of the horizon to the north.

	* You can pinpoint the position of objects in the local sky using its **direction** along the horizon and its **altitude** above the horizon.

#### Angular Sizes and Distances
* The farther away an object is, the smaller its angular size.
Ëœ* **Angular size** of an object is the angle it appears to span in your field of view.
* **Angular distance** between a pair of objects in the sky is the angle that appears to separate them.
	* We divide degrees into 60 **arcminutes** -> 60 **arcseconds**
	* `35Â°27'15" -> 35 degrees, 27 arcminutes, 15 arcseconds`

#### Why do Stars Rise and Set?
We are turning in place so certain times of the day, certain stars are available to us that are not available at other times. This gives the illusion that they are *rising* and *setting*
* Stars near the north celestial pole are **circumpolar** (remain perpetually above the horizon)
* Earth's west-to-east rotation makes stars appear to move from east to west through the sky.

#### Why do Constellations we see depend on latitude and time of year?
##### Variation with Latitude
* **Latitude** measures north-south position on Earth and **longitude** measures east-west position.
* Latitude affects the constellations we see because it affects the locations of the horizon and the zenith relative to the celestial sphere.
* This is important to navigation: the altitude of the celestial pole in your sky is equal to your latitude.

##### Variation with Time of Year
* The constellations visible at a particular time of night change as we orbit the Sun.
* The constellations along the ecliptic make up what we call the **zodiac**

### 2.2 The Reason for Seasons

#### What causes the seasons?
* The tilt of Earth's axis causes sunlight to fall differently on Earth at different times of the year.
* We use the **equinoxes** and **solstices** to mark the progression of the seasons.
	* The Sun rises precisely due east and sets precisely due west on the March and September equinoxes.
* Precession is what happens as the Earth's rotating axis changes amounts.

### 2.3 The Moon, Our Constant Companion

#### Why do we see phases of the moon?
* As the Moon orbits Earth, it returns to same position about every 29 1/2 days.
* The **lunar phase** of the Moon depends on its position relative to the Sun as it orbits Earth.  These phases are affected by two things:
	* The part of the Moon facing the Sun will be bright while the other half is dark.
	* As we orbit and rotate, we see different combinations of bright and dark faces.
* The moon's phase also affects its rise and set times.

### 2.4 The Ancient Mystery of the Planets

#### Planetary Motion
* A planet appears to move backwards relative to the stars during the period when Earth passes it in orbit.
* **Stellar parallax** explains the shifting of how things look at different
